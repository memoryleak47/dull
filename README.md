`dull` lang is, as the name suggests, not a very interesting programming language.
It's what you get when you remove basically all features from a functional programming language.
Somewhat like the lambda calculus, but - for me personally - notably easier to work with.

`dull` might be useful as a very manageable sandbox language, in which it's easy to try out new language feature ideas.
Or it might not, we'll see.
